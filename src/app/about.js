                My journey took an exciting turn when I decided to pursue a career change and dive into the world of computer science. At Hive Helsinki, I discovered the boundless creativity and problem-solving potential that technology offers.
                I'm thrilled to continue exploring and expanding my knowledge in full stack and front-end development, all while keeping an eye on design and creative coding.
